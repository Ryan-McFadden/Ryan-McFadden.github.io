I'm always really bad about finding where to start something, this blog post included. The project was defiently for me the same issue. Trying to find a topic I cared enough about to be able to put the energy that would make me feel purpose in my project beyond the completion was tough. Once I found it though I was off. This was a very cdonfidence boosting project for me. I feel that I really understood my code and was able to write what I wanted without comprimise in finding a different solution. It has only been a month but at the same time **IT'S BEEN A MONTH!** To think that I would be able to make something from scratch in such a short time is amazing and im more driven then ever to continue with this course. I'm very sure that my code is not perfect and I'm actually excited for the review and see what it is I can improve. Shame they can't do much for some of my writting errors...
