It's finally here. The end of the course and with it hopefully graduation. I'm not really sure what is gonna happen (though I do hope I pass my assessment) but I have really enjoyed these last five months. I'm going to miss this and while I will always continue to learn even after my first job and beyond that I will miss this enviorment, my cohort lead and these lessons that made me ready for the future I will have as a coder.
