For this project I made a replica of the Twitter Home page. I includes the ability to post Tweets and add Comments to those tweets. I added an Infinite scroll to the feed with no scroll bar and various other css attributes to replicate it almost completely. I also imported some external tweets to give it a more full feel.

To run the program youll need to

* cd into the API and run 'rails s'
* cd out and then into the frontend then run 'npm install && npm start'

After that youll have the app up and running and can post or comment on existing posts as a default user. I found it quite fun to replicate the structure of another program especially the infinite scroll.
