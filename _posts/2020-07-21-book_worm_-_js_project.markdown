This project was incrediably fun, almost as much as it was frustrating... almost. I see why alot of my friends who have been coding for some time now told me I would build a love hate relationship with JavaScript and I can see why. Just as it is amazing to see a website dynamically change and update as you use it makes it equally frustrating once you start having to debug. This mostly came from the fact that my understanding of JS was not up to where I wanted it to be and that made it more difficult that in should have been. I will definetly be taking the time during this last month to really take some extra time to increase my affinity with the program and I look forward to working with it in the future.
